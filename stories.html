				<h4> The Roof </h4>
				<section>
					<img class="odd"  src="images/roof.jpg" alt=""><p> As the weather warmed up, the windows of the house opened. Human daddy was enjoying the morning and getting ready to go to work.  On the closet, there was a window and it was cracked open. Mieux, like he usually did sat there, just watching daddy and enjoying the warm weather, except this day, daddy had the window open and somehow the screen had opened too. Mieux, like the opportunist that he is, made the decision he wanted to get some fresh air. He figured, hey opened window… right over the roof, I like heights, let me take a stroll. Daddy, proceeds to his room to change  and as he looks out the window, who is taking a roof stroll?? Yeap, you guessed it Mieux, just walking around like nothing is happening. Daddy starts running around, opens the window and knew he would have to handle this with much finesse and caution to invite him back inside. From the window, daddy begins to sign Mieux’s favorite tune, the tuna song… TUUUUUNAAAA… TUUUUUNAAA, he turns around to the open window and jumps back inside. Nope, no tuna for you, you nutty cat. 	 </p>

				<h4> The Door </h4>
				<section>
					<img class="even"  src="images/kitchen.jpg" alt="">
					<p> Mieux has a way to get himself into, well, just about any nook and cranny of the house. This is a pretty remarkable capability that cats have. One day, his human mom was running late for work and was on her way to a conference. Without checking, which was usually something his mom would always do because Mieux and his mom Lulu would love to get into things, walks out of the house and closes the door very quickly. As the door shuts, a loud desperate meow is heard….YEAP, Mieux decided that it was a good idea to walk on the door frame and when mom turns around, all she sees is a cat holding onto dear life with a jammed paw. At that moment, his human mom screams…runs back and Mieux hides under the couch. Clearly, he was not happy and very upset. Poor mom was sobbing and dragged him because she knew he hurt his little paw. After an intense meowy exchange, Mieux comes out and mom got a look at that paw, which ended up just being a bruised claw. A little limping for one day, but nothing a few “extra” treats helped. By the next day, he was up and running again. Lesson learned, he never ventured by the door frame and has since preached the good word of what happens when kitties take that path. </p>

				<h4> The Closet </h4>
				<section>
					<img class="odd"  src="images/closet.jpg" alt=""><p>Mieux has a lot of closet stories. This is a fun place to hide, nap and just enjoy time away from the hustle and bustle. This one-day, human mommy was cleaning the house, organizing and going into the closet back and forth. Mieux, like he always did, was following mommy around, chatting, telling her about his day and his trials and tribulations. Mommy had just finished organizing the closet. All the shoes were in order, pants, shirts and all odds and ends. She continued to work and clean upstairs when in a matter of about 15 minutes, she hears some sounds coming from the closet. Mommy very slowly proceeds to the closet and to her surprise opens the door to find a cat hanging from her dress, with pretty much a full closet rearrangement. This were reorganized with jeans on the floor, shoes hanging from the side, dresses and shirts that did not need to hang. His cat mom Lulu apparently joined him, as she was found behind a pile of clothes in one dark corner of the closet taking a nap. When she was confronted by her human mommy, she looked up and gave her a firm meow. Till this day human mom doesn’t really know if there may have been a cat family trifle. She never asked…the mysterious closetgate. Human mommy proceeded to “reorganize.”	 </p>

				<h4> The Bathroom </h4>
				<section>
					<img class="even"  src="images/bathroom.jpg" alt=""><p>One sunny Saturday, human mom, dad and sister decided to go out for a boating day and some ice cream. Figured, why not, let’s spend a day out and enjoy the warm weather.  Before leaving, like they always do, they did a kitty inventory. As they left, mom realized she forgot something at home, so she goes back in and runs to the bathroom. At that point, Mieux saw her come back and he “seemed” he was just outside the bathroom waiting. Mom looked back and nothing was there, so the door was shut. A few hours later, the family comes back and hears a desperate cry resonating throughout the house. Mom and sister are running around, opening every room door and downstairs bathroom looking for Mieux. Finally, the bathroom upstairs is opened…there it was… mayhem, ripped toilet paper, trash can on the floor and well, pretty much a hot mess. Who runs out, you bet, it was Mieux. He climbs to the bed and proceeds to chatter all shis pain and suffering during this ordeal. Certainly, it wasn’t anyone’s fault, and this was conveyed with an apology, which he accepted. As the bathroom was getting cleaned up the family understood he may have had to use the potty. He was such a gentleman that he took daddy’s towel, dragged it on the floor and did his “pee pee” business (nope no poo). 	 </p>
